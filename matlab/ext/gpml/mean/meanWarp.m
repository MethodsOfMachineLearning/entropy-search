function [m,dm] = meanWarp(mean, g, dg, hyp, x)

% meanWarp - compose a mean function by warping another mean function m0.
%
% m(x) = g( m_0(x) ).
%
% The hyperparameter is:
%
% hyp = [ hyp_m0 ]
%
% This function doesn't actually compute very much on its own, it merely does
% some bookkeeping, and calls other mean function to do the actual work.
